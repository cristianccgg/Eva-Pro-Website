            <span class="font-bold">1. General Information</span> <br />We may
            The content provided by EVA Pro ("the Service") is for informational
            and educational purposes only. EVA Pro is a service provided by
            Automate HQ Inc. ("we", "our", "us"), which offers AI-driven
            solutions for e-learning and industrial applications. While we
            strive to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the content
            generated by our software, we cannot guarantee its completeness,
            accuracy, or applicability to every specific situation or request.
            <br />
            <br />
            <span class="font-bold">2. AI-Generated Content</span> <br />
            The videos and other content generated by EVA Pro are produced using
            advanced AI technology. As a result, these AI-generated materials
            may contain inaccuracies, issues with text, or distorted images. We
            are aware that course videos generated on the software may not
            always be accurate representations and may have various issues due
            to the nature of AI-generated content. <br />
            <br />
            <span class="font-bold">3. Accuracy and Quality</span> <br />
            At Automate HQ Inc., we are committed to continually improving the
            accuracy and quality of our AI-generated content. Some courses, such
            as OSHA-required or safety courses, are frequently checked for
            accuracy to ensure they meet certification requirements.<br />
            <ul class="list-disc pl-5 ml-5">
              <li>
                Course Language: Generated with greater than 99% accuracy.
              </li>
              <li>Course Voiceover: Achieves over 92% accuracy.</li>
              <li>
                AI-Generated Videos: We aim for a reasonable accuracy rate of
                approximately 85%, acknowledging that issues with text and image
                distortion may still occur. Videos generated on software will
                NOT be accurate.
              </li>
            </ul>
            We conduct internal verification and frequent checks on
            OSHA-required and safety courses to ensure they meet certification
            standards and maintain a high level of accuracy.

            <br />
            <span class="font-bold">4. User Ratings and QC Verification</span>
            <br />
            Courses in the library that include a blue checkmark have been
            checked by our internal QC team to ensure all criteria are met and
            the course is of similar quality to other e-learning courses. You
            may also look at the course rating to see what other users thought
            of it. Ratings are available on courses that do not have a blue
            checkmark.
